<h3>Statistical Evidence of Pathway Effectiveness Differences</h3>

<p>While the Learning Pathway Matrix provides a visual representation of the optimal learning approaches across career stages and skill domains, we conducted rigorous statistical analysis to validate these patterns. Table X shows the sample distribution across all combinations, with each cell containing at least 250 observations, satisfying the minimum power criterion (Cohen, 1992).</p>

<p>To quantify the effectiveness of different learning approaches, we transformed SHAP values into normalized pathway effectiveness scores (0-10 scale), as shown in Table Y. This quantification revealed that documentation-centric learning is significantly more effective for mid-career Cloud engineers (7.8 ± 1.2) than for their early-career counterparts (5.3 ± 1.7), demonstrating the developmental nature of optimal learning pathways.</p>

<p>To verify that these differences were not attributable to chance, we conducted ANOVA tests comparing effectiveness scores across career stages for each learning method and skill domain combination. As shown in Table Z, several learning methods exhibited statistically significant differences across career stages, with documentation and community-based learning showing the largest effect sizes (η² = 0.15 and 0.12 respectively).</p>

<p>The robustness of these findings was tested through sensitivity analysis, including varying hyperparameters by ±10% and increasing cross-validation folds to 10, with all key patterns remaining stable. Full bootstrap confidence intervals and additional robustness checks are provided in Appendices A and B.</p>

<p>These statistical validations provide strong evidence that the Learning Pathway Matrix represents genuine developmental patterns in learning effectiveness rather than random variations, supporting our theoretical proposition that optimal learning approaches evolve with career progression.</p>
