<h3>Appendix B. Robustness Checks</h3>

<p>To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted several robustness checks:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Hyperparameter sensitivity:</strong> Varying model hyperparameters by ±10% resulted in minimal changes to effectiveness scores (≤ 0.5 points), indicating stability in our results.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-validation stability:</strong> Increasing cross-validation folds from 5 to 10 maintained the ranking of top learning methods within each career stage and skill domain combination.</li>
    <li><strong>Sample size stability:</strong> Reducing the sample to 80% of its original size through random sampling preserved the key patterns identified in the full dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Alternative models:</strong> Running parallel analyses with Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models yielded consistent patterns of learning effectiveness across career stages.</li>
</ul>

<p>These checks confirm that our findings are not artifacts of specific methodological choices but represent robust patterns in the data.</p>
